# rate variation, hybridization, & trait evolution in the Neotropical Lobelioids

## goal and model

Goal: assess whether rate variation is present, 
and how it can affect our findings of hybridization and trait evolution
in the Neotropical Lobelioids (genera Centropogon, Siphocampylus,
and Burmeistera, with a focus on the former two.)

1. Is there hybridization in the Centropogonid clade?
Hypothesis: Hybridization is present in the centropogonid clade, particularly between currently co-occurring congeners with shared pollinators.
2. If so, can hybridization explain (seemingly) convergent trait variation? 
Hypothesis: At least one of the proposed pollinator syndrome shifts between bat and hummingbird is a result of hybridization and is inherited through gene flow.
